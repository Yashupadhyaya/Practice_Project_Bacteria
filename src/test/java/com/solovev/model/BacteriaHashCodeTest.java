"""
Scenario 1: Validate HashCode Consistency
Details:
  TestName: validateHashCodeConsistency
  Description: This test is meant to check the consistency of the hashCode method. If called multiple times on the same object, hashCode should consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons is modified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two identical bacteria objects.
  Act: Compute the hashCode of both objects multiple times.
  Assert: Verify that the hashCode remains consistent across multiple invocations for the same object.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the consistency of the hashCode method. This is important to ensure correct operation in collections such as HashMap, HashSet, etc.

Scenario 2: Validate HashCode Equality for Identical Objects
Details:
  TestName: validateHashCodeEqualityForIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the equality of hashCode for two identical objects. If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two identical bacteria objects.
  Act: Compute the hashCode for both objects.
  Assert: Verify that the hashCode is the same for both objects.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method adheres to its general contract. This is important to ensure correct operation in collections such as HashMap, HashSet, etc.

Scenario 3: Validate HashCode Difference for Non-Identical Objects
Details:
  TestName: validateHashCodeDifferenceForNonIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the difference of hashCode for two non-identical objects. If two objects are not equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects doesn't necessarily produce distinct integer results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two non-identical bacteria objects.
  Act: Compute the hashCode for both objects.
  Assert: Verify that the hashCode is not the same for both objects.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method adheres to its general contract. This is important to ensure correct operation in collections such as HashMap, HashSet, etc.
