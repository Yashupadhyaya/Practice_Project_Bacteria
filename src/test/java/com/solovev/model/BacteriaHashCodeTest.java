"""
Scenario 1: Validate HashCode Consistency
Details:
  TestName: validateHashCodeConsistency
  Description: This test is meant to check the consistency of the hashCode method. If called multiple times on the same object, hashCode should consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons is modified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two identical bacteria objects.
  Act: Compute the hashCode of both objects multiple times.
  Assert: Verify that the hashCode remains consistent across multiple invocations for the same object.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the consistency of the hashCode method. This is important to ensure correct operation in collections such as HashMap, HashSet, etc.

Scenario 2: Validate HashCode Equality for Identical Objects
Details:
  TestName: validateHashCodeEqualityForIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the equality of hashCode for two identical objects. If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two identical bacteria objects.
  Act: Compute the hashCode for both objects.
  Assert: Verify that the hashCode is the same for both objects.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method adheres to its general contract. This is important to ensure correct operation in collections such as HashMap, HashSet, etc.

Scenario 3: Validate HashCode Difference for Non-Identical Objects
Details:
  TestName: validateHashCodeDifferenceForNonIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check the difference of hashCode for two non-identical objects. If two objects are not equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects doesn't necessarily produce distinct integer results.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two non-identical bacteria objects.
  Act: Compute the hashCode for both objects.
  Assert: Verify that the hashCode is not the same for both objects.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode method adheres to its general contract. This is important to ensure correct operation in collections such as HashMap, HashSet, etc.

/*
The error logs indicate that the TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests. This is not an issue with the actual test case or the business logic, but rather a problem with the test execution environment. 

The issue could be due to a number of reasons:

1. The version of JUnit specified in the project's Maven dependencies may be incompatible with the version of the JUnit platform running the tests. The warning 'dependencies.dependency.version' for org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:jar is either LATEST or RELEASE (both of them are being deprecated) suggests that the configured JUnit version could be causing the issue.

2. The test classes might not be in the correct location or the naming conventions for the test classes might not be correct. The JUnit Jupiter engine might not be able to find the test classes if they are not in the appropriate directory or if they do not follow the naming conventions.

3. There could be an issue with the project's build configuration or the Maven Surefire Plugin configuration. The error message indicates a build failure and specifically mentions an error in the forked process, which suggests that the tests might not be correctly configured to run.

In order to resolve this issue, the project's dependencies and build configuration should be reviewed and corrected as necessary. The version of JUnit should be specified explicitly instead of using LATEST or RELEASE, the test classes should be checked to ensure they are in the correct location and follow the naming conventions, and the Maven Surefire Plugin configuration should be reviewed to ensure it is correctly set up to run the tests.

    int hashCode3 = bacteria1.hashCode();
    assertEquals(hashCode1, hashCode2, "The hash codes are not consistent.");
    assertEquals(hashCode1, hashCode3, "The hash codes are not consistent.");

The test failure is not due to any issues with the test case or the business logic. The error logs indicate that the test engine 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests. This is not a problem with the test itself, but rather with the configuration of the testing framework or the environment.

This error generally occurs when there is a version mismatch between Junit Jupiter and the Maven Surefire plugin. It's recommended to use the latest versions of both Junit Jupiter and Maven Surefire plugin which are compatible with each other.

Also, the logs mention some warnings about the project's pom.xml file. The 'dependencies.dependency.version' for org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:jar is either LATEST or RELEASE, both of which are being deprecated. This might be causing issues with the Maven build and consequently the test discovery.

Therefore, the prerequisites to run the test would be to update the versions of Junit Jupiter and Maven Surefire plugin in the pom.xml file to their latest stable versions that are compatible with each other, and replace the LATEST or RELEASE tag with the specific version number. Also, ensure that the environment in which the tests are being run is correctly configured to avoid any path or dependency issues.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void validateHashCodeEqualityForIdenticalObjects() {
    Bacteria bacteria1 = new Bacteria();
    bacteria1.setAge(1);
    bacteria1.setSterile(true);
    Bacteria bacteria2 = new Bacteria();
    bacteria2.setAge(1);
    bacteria2.setSterile(true);
    assertEquals(bacteria1.hashCode(), bacteria2.hashCode(), "The hash codes are not equal for identical objects.");

The log indicates that the test engine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests. This error usually occurs due to incompatible or incorrect versions of the testing libraries in the project.

The warning at the start of the log also suggests that the version for 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:jar' is either LATEST or RELEASE. Both LATEST and RELEASE are deprecated as version choices in Maven, and it's recommended to specify a concrete version instead.

Additionally, the build failure is not due to the test case logic itself, as the log does not show any assertion errors or exceptions thrown from the test case. It seems to be more of a configuration issue with the test setup or the project dependencies.

To fix this, you should check the project's pom.xml file and ensure that the correct and compatible versions of JUnit and other related libraries are being used. You might need to update the versions of these dependencies to the ones compatible with your project setup. 

Please note that without the actual test project setup or the pom.xml file, the exact cause of the issue cannot be determined, and the above explanation is based on the provided log information.

    bacteria2.setAge(2);
    bacteria2.setSterile(false);
