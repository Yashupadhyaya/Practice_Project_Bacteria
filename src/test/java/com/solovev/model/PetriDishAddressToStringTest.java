Scenario 1: Validate the toString method for a valid Address object

Details:
  TestName: testToStringForValidAddress.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method correctly returns the string representation of the Address object in the expected format.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Address object with given x and y coordinates.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected string representation.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly formats the string representation of the Address object. The expected result is based on the known format "Address{x,y}". This test is significant as it ensures that the toString method correctly represents the state of the Address object.

Scenario 2: Validate the toString method for an Address object with negative x and y coordinates

Details:
  TestName: testToStringForNegativeCoordinates.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method correctly returns the string representation of the Address object when x and y coordinates are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with negative x and y coordinates.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected string representation.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method can handle negative coordinates correctly. The expected result is based on the known format "Address{x,y}". This test is significant as it ensures that the toString method correctly represents the state of the Address object, even when the coordinates are negative.

Scenario 3: Validate the toString method for an Address object with zero coordinates

Details:
  TestName: testToStringForZeroCoordinates.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method correctly returns the string representation of the Address object when x and y coordinates are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object with zero x and y coordinates.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the created Address object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected string representation.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method can handle zero coordinates correctly. The expected result is based on the known format "Address{x,y}". This test is significant as it ensures that the toString method correctly represents the state of the Address object, even when the coordinates are zero.
