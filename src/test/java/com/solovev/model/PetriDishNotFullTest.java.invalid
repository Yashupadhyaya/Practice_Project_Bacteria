""" 
Scenario 1: Test when dish is not full

Details:  
  TestName: testNotFull
  Description: This test is meant to check if the dish is not full. The scenario targets the situation where the number of filled positions is less than the total size of the dish. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a PetriDish instance with a certain size and fill less than size * size.
  Act: Invoke the notFull() method on the PetriDish instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned result is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the notFull() method correctly identifies when the dish is not full. This is important to ensure the dish can accept more elements if needed.

Scenario 2: Test when dish is full

Details:  
  TestName: testFull
  Description: This test is meant to check if the dish is full. The scenario targets the situation where the number of filled positions is equal to the size of the dish. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a PetriDish instance with a certain size and fill equal to size * size.
  Act: Invoke the notFull() method on the PetriDish instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the notFull() method correctly identifies when the dish is full. This is crucial for managing resource allocation within the dish.

Scenario 3: Test with zero size dish

Details:  
  TestName: testZeroSizeDish
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method handles a zero size dish. The scenario targets the situation where the size of the dish is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a PetriDish instance with size equals to zero.
  Act: Invoke the notFull() method on the PetriDish instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the notFull() method correctly handles the edge case where the size of the dish is zero. This is important to prevent potential errors in resource management.
