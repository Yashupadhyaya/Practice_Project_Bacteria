"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if emptyNeighbors returns correct neighbors when the address is in the middle of the petridish.

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyNeighborsForMiddleAddress
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns the correct neighbors when the address is situated somewhere in the middle of the petridish. The expected result would be all the 8 surrounding addresses.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address with coordinates somewhere in the middle of the petridish.
  Act: Invoke the emptyNeighbors method on the created instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned collection contains the correct 8 addresses.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the neighbors of an address. The expected result is based on the standard rules of a grid where each cell in the middle has 8 neighbors. This test is significant in ensuring that the method behaves as expected in normal scenarios.

Scenario 2: Test to check if emptyNeighbors returns correct neighbors when the address is at the corner of the petridish.

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyNeighborsForCornerAddress
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns the correct neighbors when the address is situated at one of the corners of the petridish. The expected result would be 3 neighboring addresses.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address with coordinates at one of the corners of the petridish.
  Act: Invoke the emptyNeighbors method on the created instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned collection contains the correct 3 addresses.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the neighbors of an address situated at the corners. The expected result is based on the standard rules of a grid where each cell at the corner has 3 neighbors. This test is significant in ensuring that the method behaves as expected in edge cases.

Scenario 3: Test to check if emptyNeighbors returns correct neighbors when the address is at the edge of the petridish but not at the corners.

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyNeighborsForEdgeAddress
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns the correct neighbors when the address is situated at the edge of the petridish but not at the corners. The expected result would be 5 neighboring addresses.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of Address with coordinates at one of the edges of the petridish but not at the corners.
  Act: Invoke the emptyNeighbors method on the created instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned collection contains the correct 5 addresses.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the neighbors of an address situated at the edges but not at the corners. The expected result is based on the standard rules of a grid where each cell at the edge has 5 neighbors. This test is significant in ensuring that the method behaves as expected in edge cases.
