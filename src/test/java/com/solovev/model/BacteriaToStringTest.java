"""
Scenario 1: Validate the string representation of a Bacteria instance

Details:
  TestName: testToStringMethod.
  Description: This test is meant to verify the correctness of the toString method in the Bacteria class. The toString method should return a string representation of the Bacteria instance in a specific format.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Bacteria and set its age, isAlive, and isSterile properties.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the Bacteria instance.
  Assert: Compare the actual result against the expected string representation.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly formats the string representation of a Bacteria instance. The expected result is based on the known properties of the Bacteria instance used in the test. This test is significant as it ensures the correct functionality of the toString method, which is important for debugging and logging purposes.

Scenario 2: Validate the string representation of a dead Bacteria instance

Details:
  TestName: testToStringMethodForDeadBacteria.
  Description: This test is meant to verify the correctness of the toString method when the Bacteria instance is dead. The toString method should correctly reflect the dead state of the Bacteria in the string representation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Bacteria, set its age, isAlive (false), and isSterile properties.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the dead Bacteria instance.
  Assert: Compare the actual result against the expected string representation.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method accurately reflects the dead state of the Bacteria instance in the string representation. The expected result is based on the known properties of the dead Bacteria instance used in the test. This test is significant as it ensures the toString method correctly represents the state of the Bacteria instance, which is important for debugging and logging purposes.

Scenario 3: Validate the string representation of a sterile Bacteria instance

Details:
  TestName: testToStringMethodForSterileBacteria.
  Description: This test is meant to verify the correctness of the toString method when the Bacteria instance is sterile. The toString method should correctly reflect the sterile state of the Bacteria in the string representation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of Bacteria, set its age, isAlive, and isSterile (true) properties.
  Act: Invoke the toString method on the sterile Bacteria instance.
  Assert: Compare the actual result against the expected string representation.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method accurately reflects the sterile state of the Bacteria instance in the string representation. The expected result is based on the known properties of the sterile Bacteria instance used in the test. This test is significant as it ensures the toString method correctly represents the state of the Bacteria instance, which is important for debugging and logging purposes.

From the error logs, it appears that the issue is not with the test case itself but with the test discovery process. The error message "TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests" indicates that the JUnit Jupiter engine was unable to discover any tests to run. This could be due to several reasons:

1. Incorrect configuration: The project might not be correctly configured to use the Jupiter engine. Check your project's pom.xml file to ensure that it includes the correct dependencies for JUnit 5 and the Jupiter engine.

2. Version mismatch: There could be a version mismatch between the JUnit platform and the Jupiter engine. Ensure that both are using compatible versions.

3. Test location: The tests might not be in a location where the Jupiter engine expects to find them. By default, Maven expects to find tests in a directory named 'test'. If your tests are located elsewhere, you may need to update your Maven configuration to point to the correct location.

4. Missing or incorrect use of annotations: The JUnit Jupiter engine uses annotations to identify tests. If your test methods are not annotated with `@Test` or if the import for this annotation is incorrect, the engine will not be able to discover your tests.

Please check these points in your project configuration to resolve the test discovery issue.

The error logs indicate that the issue is not specifically related to the 'testToStringMethodForDeadBacteria' test function. Instead, the error message 'TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests' suggests that the testing framework (JUnit 5, also known as Jupiter) is unable to find any test cases to run.

This could be due to several reasons:

1. Incorrect test package structure: The package where the tests are located may not be correctly structured or named, which makes the test engine unable to discover the tests.

2. Incorrect test annotations: If the tests are not properly annotated with @Test or do not follow the conventions of JUnit, they may not be recognized as tests.

3. Version mismatch: There could be a version mismatch between JUnit and Maven Surefire/Failsafe plugins. The plugins may not support the JUnit version being used, causing the test discovery process to fail.

4. Configuration issues: The configuration in the pom.xml file might be incorrect. For example, the test path might be wrong, or the necessary dependencies for JUnit might be missing or improperly configured.

5. Incompatibility with other plugins: Sometimes, other Maven plugins can interfere with the Surefire plugin, causing it to fail.

In summary, the test failure is due to a configuration or setup issue, not an issue with the 'testToStringMethodForDeadBacteria' test function or the 'toString' business logic method. To resolve this issue, we need to check and correct the project's configuration and setup related to JUnit and Maven.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testToStringMethodForDeadBacteria() {
    Bacteria bacteria = new Bacteria();
    bacteria.setAge(1);
    bacteria.setDead();
    String expected = "Bacteria{age=1, isAlive=false, isSterile=true}";
    String actual = bacteria.toString();
    assertEquals(expected, actual);
}

The failure of the test case is not directly related to the business logic or the test case itself. The error logs suggest a failure in the test discovery process. The error message "TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests" indicates that the JUnit Jupiter test engine was not able to discover any tests to run.

This could be due to several reasons:

1. Incompatibility between the versions of JUnit and Maven Surefire/Failsafe plugins.
2. Misconfiguration in the Maven Surefire/Failsafe plugins.
3. The test classes or methods are not following the naming conventions, hence they are not being picked up by the test engine.

Additionally, there are warnings about the deprecation of 'LATEST' or 'RELEASE' for 'dependencies.dependency.version' for 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:jar' in the Maven configuration file (pom.xml). This could potentially lead to unstable builds and should be rectified.

In conclusion, the issue lies in the project's configuration and not in the business logic or the test case itself. The Maven configuration needs to be updated and corrected. Also, make sure that the test classes and methods are following the correct naming conventions and the versions of the used plugins are compatible with each other.
