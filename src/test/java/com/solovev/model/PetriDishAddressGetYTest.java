Scenario 1: Verify getY method returns correct y-coordinate value

Details:
  TestName: testGetYReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getY method returns the correct y-coordinate value of the Address class.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a known y-coordinate value.
    Act: Invoke the getY method on the instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the known y-coordinate value.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getY method accurately retrieves the y-coordinate from the Address instance. The expected result is based on the known y-coordinate value set in the Arrange step. This test is significant as it ensures the getY method functions correctly, which is crucial for retrieving the y-coordinate of an address in a PetriDish.

Scenario 2: Verify getY method handles negative y-coordinate values

Details:
  TestName: testGetYWithNegativeValue
  Description: This test is meant to check how the getY method handles negative y-coordinate values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a negative y-coordinate value.
    Act: Invoke the getY method on the instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the negative y-coordinate value.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getY method can handle negative y-coordinate values. The expected result is based on the negative y-coordinate value set in the Arrange step. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the getY method, ensuring it can handle any y-coordinate value, including negatives.

Scenario 3: Verify getY method handles zero y-coordinate value

Details:
  TestName: testGetYWithZeroValue
  Description: This test is meant to check how the getY method handles a zero y-coordinate value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a zero y-coordinate value.
    Act: Invoke the getY method on the instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to assert that the returned value is zero.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getY method can handle a zero y-coordinate value. The expected result is zero, as set in the Arrange step. This test is significant as it ensures the getY method can accurately return a zero y-coordinate, which is crucial in a grid-based system like a PetriDish.
