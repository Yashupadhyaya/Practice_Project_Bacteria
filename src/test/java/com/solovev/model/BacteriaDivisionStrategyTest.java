Scenario 1: Test to check divisionStrategy for a sterile bacteria

Details:
  TestName: testDivisionStrategyForSterileBacteria
  Description: This test is meant to check the divisionStrategy method when the bacteria is sterile. As per the method definition, a sterile bacteria cannot reproduce and hence the method should return null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a sterile Bacteria instance.
  Act: Invoke the divisionStrategy method on the sterile bacteria instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the method invocation is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that a sterile bacteria cannot reproduce. The expected result is null because as per the business logic, sterile bacteria cannot reproduce.

Scenario 2: Test to check divisionStrategy for a non-sterile bacteria

Details:
  TestName: testDivisionStrategyForNonSterileBacteria
  Description: This test is meant to check the divisionStrategy method when the bacteria is not sterile. The method can return null or a new bacteria instance based on a random probability.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a non-sterile Bacteria instance.
  Act: Invoke the divisionStrategy method on the non-sterile bacteria instance multiple times.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the method invocations is either null or a new Bacteria instance.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that a non-sterile bacteria can reproduce based on a random probability. The expected result is either null or a new Bacteria instance as per the business logic.

Scenario 3: Test to check divisionStrategy for a dead bacteria

Details:
  TestName: testDivisionStrategyForDeadBacteria
  Description: This test is meant to check the divisionStrategy method when the bacteria is dead. As per the method definition, a dead bacteria cannot reproduce and hence the method should return null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a dead Bacteria instance.
  Act: Invoke the divisionStrategy method on the dead bacteria instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the method invocation is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that a dead bacteria cannot reproduce. The expected result is null because as per the business logic, dead bacteria cannot reproduce.

Scenario 4: Test to check divisionStrategy for a bacteria with maximum age

Details:
  TestName: testDivisionStrategyForOldBacteria
  Description: This test is meant to check the divisionStrategy method when the bacteria is at the maximum age. As per the method definition, a bacteria with maximum age becomes sterile and hence the method should return null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Bacteria instance with maximum age.
  Act: Invoke the divisionStrategy method on the bacteria instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result of the method invocation is null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that a bacteria with maximum age cannot reproduce. The expected result is null because as per the business logic, bacteria with maximum age become sterile and cannot reproduce.
