Scenario 1: Test to check if bacteria dies after reaching DEAD_DAYS

Details:
  TestName: testBacteriaDiesAfterDeadDays
  Description: This test checks if a bacteria dies after reaching the age of DEAD_DAYS. The test should validate that the boolean value returned by the growOld() method is true, indicating that the bacteria has died.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a bacteria instance and set its age to DEAD_DAYS.
  Act: Invoke the growOld() method on the bacteria instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned boolean value is true.
Validation:
  This test validates whether the bacteria dies after reaching the age of DEAD_DAYS. If the assertion is true, it means that the method correctly identifies when the bacteria should die, which is a crucial part of the bacteria's lifecycle management.

Scenario 2: Test to check if bacteria becomes sterile after reaching STERILE_DAYS

Details:
  TestName: testBacteriaBecomesSterileAfterSterileDays
  Description: This test checks if a bacteria becomes sterile after reaching the age of STERILE_DAYS. The test should validate that the isSterile() method returns true, indicating that the bacteria has become sterile.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a bacteria instance and set its age to STERILE_DAYS.
  Act: Invoke the growOld() method on the bacteria instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the isSterile() method returns true.
Validation:
  This test validates whether the bacteria becomes sterile after reaching the age of STERILE_DAYS. If the assertion is true, it means that the method correctly identifies when the bacteria should become sterile, which is a crucial part of the bacteria's lifecycle management.

Scenario 3: Test to check if bacteria remains alive and fertile before reaching DEAD_DAYS and STERILE_DAYS

Details:
  TestName: testBacteriaRemainsAliveAndFertileBeforeDeadAndSterileDays
  Description: This test checks if a bacteria remains alive and fertile before reaching the age of DEAD_DAYS and STERILE_DAYS. The test should validate that the isAlive() method returns true and the isSterile() method returns false, indicating that the bacteria is alive and fertile.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a bacteria instance and set its age to a value less than DEAD_DAYS and STERILE_DAYS.
  Act: Invoke the growOld() method on the bacteria instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the isAlive() method returns true and the isSterile() method returns false.
Validation:
  This test validates whether the bacteria remains alive and fertile before reaching the age of DEAD_DAYS and STERILE_DAYS. If the assertions are true, it means that the method correctly identifies when the bacteria should remain alive and fertile, which is a crucial part of the bacteria's lifecycle management.
