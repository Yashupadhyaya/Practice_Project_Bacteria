Scenario 1: Test to check if bacteria dies after reaching the DEAD_DAYS age

Details:
  TestName: testBacteriaDiesAfterReachingDeadDays.
  Description: This test is to check if the bacteria dies after reaching the DEAD_DAYS age. This will test the functionality of the growOld method in the scenario when the bacteria's age reaches the DEAD_DAYS.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Bacteria instance and set its age to DEAD_DAYS.
  Act: Invoke the growOld method on the Bacteria instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the bacteria is dead.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the bacteria dies after reaching the DEAD_DAYS age. This is important to ensure that the bacteria lifecycle is correctly implemented.

Scenario 2: Test to check if bacteria becomes sterile after reaching the STERILE_DAYS age

Details:
  TestName: testBacteriaBecomesSterileAfterReachingSterileDays.
  Description: This test is to check if the bacteria becomes sterile after reaching the STERILE_DAYS age. This will test the functionality of the growOld method in the scenario when the bacteria's age reaches the STERILE_DAYS.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Bacteria instance and set its age to STERILE_DAYS.
  Act: Invoke the growOld method on the Bacteria instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the bacteria is sterile.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the bacteria becomes sterile after reaching the STERILE_DAYS age. This is important to ensure that the bacteria lifecycle is correctly implemented.

Scenario 3: Test to check if bacteria remains alive and fertile before reaching the DEAD_DAYS or STERILE_DAYS age

Details:
  TestName: testBacteriaRemainsAliveAndFertileBeforeDeadOrSterileDays.
  Description: This test is to check if the bacteria remains alive and fertile before reaching the DEAD_DAYS or STERILE_DAYS age. This will test the functionality of the growOld method in the scenario when the bacteria's age is less than the DEAD_DAYS or STERILE_DAYS.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Bacteria instance and set its age to less than DEAD_DAYS and STERILE_DAYS.
  Act: Invoke the growOld method on the Bacteria instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the bacteria is alive and not sterile.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the bacteria remains alive and fertile before reaching the DEAD_DAYS or STERILE_DAYS age. This is important to ensure that the bacteria lifecycle is correctly implemented.

The test case failure is not due to the test case itself or the business logic, but it's because of the test environment setup. The error logs indicate that the Maven build failed to discover the tests and execute them. This is often due to a configuration issue in the project.

The key errors are:

1. 'dependencies.dependency.version' for org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:jar is either LATEST or RELEASE (both of them are being deprecated) - This indicates that the version of the junit-jupiter dependency in the Maven pom.xml file is set to LATEST or RELEASE, which are deprecated. This needs to be updated to a specific version.

2. TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests - This indicates that the Junit 5 engine failed to discover the tests. This could be due to an incorrect or missing configuration in the pom.xml file. The project might not be properly configured to use Junit 5, or there might be a version mismatch between Junit and Maven Surefire/Failsafe plugins.

3. BUILD FAILURE - This shows that the Maven build failed, which means the tests did not even run.

To resolve these issues, the pom.xml file should be updated with the correct versions of the dependencies. The project should be properly configured to use Junit 5. The versions of the Maven Surefire/Failsafe plugins should be compatible with the Junit version. If these configurations are correct, the tests should be discovered and executed properly.

    // Assert
    assertTrue(died, "Bacteria did not die after reaching DEAD_DAYS");
    assertFalse(bacteria.isAlive(), "Bacteria is still alive after reaching DEAD_DAYS");

The error logs suggest that the issue is not with the test case itself, but rather with the Maven Surefire Plugin not being able to discover and run the test. The specific error message is "TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests".

This issue could be due to several reasons:

1. Incorrect or incompatible versions of the Maven Surefire Plugin or JUnit: The project seems to be using JUnit Jupiter, which requires at least version 2.22.0 of the Maven Surefire Plugin. If the project is using an older version, the plugin might not be able to discover and run the tests. Similarly, if the project is using a newer version of JUnit Jupiter but an older version of the Maven Surefire Plugin, the plugin might not support the newer features of JUnit and fail to discover the tests.

2. Misconfiguration of the Maven Surefire Plugin: The plugin might be misconfigured in the project's pom.xml file. For example, the plugin might be configured to look for tests in the wrong directory, or the configuration might be missing necessary parameters for JUnit Jupiter.

3. Test classes or methods not following naming conventions: By default, the Maven Surefire Plugin looks for test classes and methods that follow certain naming conventions (e.g., test classes should be named `*Test.java`, `Test*.java`, or `*TestCase.java`, and test methods should be named `test*`). If the test class or method does not follow these conventions, the plugin might not discover it.

4. Issues with the build environment: The build might be failing due to issues with the environment in which Maven is running. For example, there might be problems with the Java installation, the Maven installation, or the system's PATH variable. 

To fix the issue, check the version of the Maven Surefire Plugin and JUnit Jupiter being used, and ensure that they are compatible. Also, check the configuration of the Maven Surefire Plugin in the pom.xml file, and ensure that the test classes and methods follow the naming conventions. If the issue persists, investigate the build environment for potential issues.

The error logs suggest that the test case failure is not due to any issues with the test method itself, but rather due to the test setup environment. The error '[ERROR] TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests' indicates that the testing engine JUnit Jupiter is not able to discover and run the tests. 

This could be due to a variety of reasons including but not limited to:

1. Incorrect or incompatible versions of JUnit and Maven Surefire/Failsafe plugins.
2. Issues with the project setup, possibly in the pom.xml file, which is causing problems in test discovery.
3. The test classes or methods might not be correctly named or placed according to Maven's standard directory layout, and hence are not being discovered.

In addition, there's a warning about the version for 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:jar' dependency being either LATEST or RELEASE, both of which are being deprecated. This could potentially lead to instability in the build process.

To resolve these errors, ensure that the project setup is correct, the versions of the JUnit and Maven plugins are compatible, and the naming conventions for the test classes and methods are according to standards.
