Scenario 1: Test to check if bacteria dies after reaching the DEAD_DAYS age

Details:
  TestName: testBacteriaDiesAfterReachingDeadDays.
  Description: This test is to check if the bacteria dies after reaching the DEAD_DAYS age. This will test the functionality of the growOld method in the scenario when the bacteria's age reaches the DEAD_DAYS.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Bacteria instance and set its age to DEAD_DAYS.
  Act: Invoke the growOld method on the Bacteria instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the bacteria is dead.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the bacteria dies after reaching the DEAD_DAYS age. This is important to ensure that the bacteria lifecycle is correctly implemented.

Scenario 2: Test to check if bacteria becomes sterile after reaching the STERILE_DAYS age

Details:
  TestName: testBacteriaBecomesSterileAfterReachingSterileDays.
  Description: This test is to check if the bacteria becomes sterile after reaching the STERILE_DAYS age. This will test the functionality of the growOld method in the scenario when the bacteria's age reaches the STERILE_DAYS.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Bacteria instance and set its age to STERILE_DAYS.
  Act: Invoke the growOld method on the Bacteria instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the bacteria is sterile.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the bacteria becomes sterile after reaching the STERILE_DAYS age. This is important to ensure that the bacteria lifecycle is correctly implemented.

Scenario 3: Test to check if bacteria remains alive and fertile before reaching the DEAD_DAYS or STERILE_DAYS age

Details:
  TestName: testBacteriaRemainsAliveAndFertileBeforeDeadOrSterileDays.
  Description: This test is to check if the bacteria remains alive and fertile before reaching the DEAD_DAYS or STERILE_DAYS age. This will test the functionality of the growOld method in the scenario when the bacteria's age is less than the DEAD_DAYS or STERILE_DAYS.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Bacteria instance and set its age to less than DEAD_DAYS and STERILE_DAYS.
  Act: Invoke the growOld method on the Bacteria instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the bacteria is alive and not sterile.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the bacteria remains alive and fertile before reaching the DEAD_DAYS or STERILE_DAYS age. This is important to ensure that the bacteria lifecycle is correctly implemented.
