Scenario 1: Testing for successful bacteria placement

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulBacteriaPlacement
    Description: This test is designed to check if the bacteria can be successfully placed at a given address when the address is not already filled with bacteria.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an Address object and a Bacteria object. 
    Act: Call the putBacteria method with the Address and Bacteria objects as parameters. 
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is true.
  Validation: 
    This assertion is checking if the bacteria was successfully placed at the given address. If the method works correctly, it should return true as the address was not previously filled with bacteria. This is crucial for the correct functioning of the application as bacteria should be able to be placed in empty addresses.

Scenario 2: Testing for unsuccessful bacteria placement due to already filled address

  Details:  
    TestName: testUnsuccessfulBacteriaPlacementDueToFilledAddress
    Description: This test is designed to check if the bacteria placement fails when the address is already filled with bacteria.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an Address object and two Bacteria objects. Place the first Bacteria object at the given address.
    Act: Call the putBacteria method with the same Address and the second Bacteria object as parameters. 
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is false.
  Validation: 
    This assertion is checking if the bacteria placement fails when the address is already filled with bacteria. If the method works correctly, it should return false as the address was previously filled with bacteria. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the application as bacteria should not be able to be placed in addresses that are already filled.

Scenario 3: Testing for unsuccessful bacteria placement due to null bacteria

  Details:  
    TestName: testUnsuccessfulBacteriaPlacementDueToNullBacteria
    Description: This test is designed to check if the bacteria placement fails when the bacteria to be placed is null.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize an Address object and set the Bacteria object as null. 
    Act: Call the putBacteria method with the Address and null Bacteria object as parameters. 
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is false.
  Validation: 
    This assertion is checking if the bacteria placement fails when the bacteria to be placed is null. If the method works correctly, it should return false as the bacteria was null. This is important for preventing null values from being placed in the addresses.
