"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify the equals method with the same object reference
Details:
  TestName: testSameObjectReference
  Description: This test aims to verify the equals method when the same object reference is passed to it. According to the equals method implementation, if the same object reference is passed, it should return true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Bacteria object.
  Act: Pass the same object reference to the equals method.
  Assert: The equals method should return true.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies the same object reference. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the equals method.

Scenario 2: Test to verify equals method with different object types
Details:
  TestName: testDifferentObjectType
  Description: This test aims to verify the equals method when an object of a different type is passed to it. According to the equals method implementation, if an object of a different type is passed, it should return false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Bacteria object and an object of a different type.
  Act: Pass the object of a different type to the equals method.
  Assert: The equals method should return false.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies different object types. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the equals method.

Scenario 3: Test to verify equals method with null object
Details:
  TestName: testNullObject
  Description: This test aims to verify the equals method when a null object is passed to it. According to the equals method implementation, if a null object is passed, it should return false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Bacteria object.
  Act: Pass a null object to the equals method.
  Assert: The equals method should return false.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies a null object. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the equals method.

Scenario 4: Test to verify equals method with equal Bacteria objects
Details:
  TestName: testEqualBacteriaObjects
  Description: This test aims to verify the equals method when two Bacteria objects with the same properties are passed. According to the equals method implementation, if two Bacteria objects have the same properties, it should return true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Bacteria objects with the same properties.
  Act: Pass one of the Bacteria objects to the equals method of the other.
  Assert: The equals method should return true.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies equal Bacteria objects. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the equals method.

Scenario 5: Test to verify equals method with unequal Bacteria objects
Details:
  TestName: testUnequalBacteriaObjects
  Description: This test aims to verify the equals method when two Bacteria objects with different properties are passed. According to the equals method implementation, if two Bacteria objects have different properties, it should return false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Bacteria objects with different properties.
  Act: Pass one of the Bacteria objects to the equals method of the other.
  Assert: The equals method should return false.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies unequal Bacteria objects. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the equals method.
