"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify if the bacteria is alive.

Details:
  TestName: verifyIfBacteriaIsAlive
  Description: This test will check if the bacteria is alive. The isAlive method will be used to check if the bacteria is alive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Bacteria object and set its isAlive property to true.
  Act: Call the isAlive method on the Bacteria object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is true.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the isAlive method correctly identifies a living bacteria. If the bacteria is alive, the isAlive method should return true.


Scenario 2: Test to verify if the bacteria is not alive.

Details:
  TestName: verifyIfBacteriaIsNotAlive
  Description: This test will check if the bacteria is not alive. The isAlive method will be used to check if the bacteria is alive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Bacteria object and set its isAlive property to false.
  Act: Call the isAlive method on the Bacteria object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is false.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the isAlive method correctly identifies a bacteria that is not alive. If the bacteria is not alive, the isAlive method should return false.


Scenario 3: Test to verify if the bacteria changes from alive to not alive.

Details:
  TestName: verifyIfBacteriaChangesFromAliveToNotAlive
  Description: This test will check if the bacteria changes from alive to not alive. The isAlive and setDead methods will be used to check this.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Bacteria object and set its isAlive property to true.
  Act: Call the setDead method on the Bacteria object and then call the isAlive method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is false.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the setDead method correctly changes the state of the bacteria from alive to not alive. After calling the setDead method, the isAlive method should return false.

Scenario 4: Test to verify the default state of a newly created bacteria.

Details:
  TestName: verifyDefaultStateOfNewBacteria
  Description: This test will check the default state of a newly created bacteria. The isAlive method will be used to check this.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Bacteria object.
  Act: Call the isAlive method on the Bacteria object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is true.
Validation:
  This test verifies that a newly created bacteria is alive by default. If no changes have been made to the bacteria, the isAlive method should return true.
