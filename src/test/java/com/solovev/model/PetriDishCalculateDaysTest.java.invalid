"""
Scenario 1: Test the calculation of days with zero configuration
Details:  
  TestName: testCalculateDaysWithZeroConfig.
  Description: This test is intended to check the scenario when the configuration of the bacteria behavior is set to zero. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a ConfigurationOfBacteriaBehavior object and set it to zero.
  Act: Invoke the calculateDays method with the zero configuration.
  Assert: Assert that the response is -1,0, which indicates that the petri dish will never be filled.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles the case where the configuration is zero. In this case, the petri dish will never be filled, so the expected response is -1,0.

Scenario 2: Test the calculation of days with a valid configuration
Details:  
  TestName: testCalculateDaysWithValidConfig.
  Description: This test is to check the functionality of the calculateDays method when the configuration of the bacteria behavior is valid. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a ConfigurationOfBacteriaBehavior object and set it to a valid value.
  Act: Invoke the calculateDays method with the valid configuration.
  Assert: Assert that the response is not -1,0, indicating that the petri dish will be filled.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly calculates the number of days required to fill the petri dish. In this case, the petri dish should be filled, so the expected response is not -1,0.

Scenario 3: Test the calculation of days when the petri dish is already full
Details:  
  TestName: testCalculateDaysWhenPetriDishIsFull.
  Description: This test is designed to check the behavior of the calculateDays method when the petri dish is already full. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a ConfigurationOfBacteriaBehavior object and set it to a valid value. Also, set the state of the petri dish to full.
  Act: Invoke the calculateDays method with the valid configuration.
  Assert: Assert that the response indicates that no additional days are required to fill the petri dish.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the case where the petri dish is already full. In this case, no additional days should be required, so the expected response is 0,0.
