  Scenario 1: Test to verify that the getAge method correctly retrieves the age of the bacteria

  Details:
    TestName: testGetAgeMethod
    Description: This test is meant to check the getAge method. The method should return the correct age of the bacteria.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of Bacteria and set the age using the setAge method.
    Act: Invoke the getAge method on the Bacteria instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getAge method to the expected result.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getAge method correctly retrieves the age of the bacteria. The expected result is the age that was previously set. This test is significant in the context of the application behavior as it ensures that the age of the bacteria is correctly managed and retrieved.

  Scenario 2: Edge Case Test to verify that the getAge method correctly handles the case where the age is not set

  Details:
    TestName: testGetAgeWhenAgeNotSet
    Description: This test is meant to check the getAge method when the age of the bacteria is not set. The method should return 0 as this is the default value for uninitialized long fields in Java.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of Bacteria without setting the age.
    Act: Invoke the getAge method on the Bacteria instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getAge method to the expected result, which is 0.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getAge method correctly handles the case where the age is not set. The expected result is 0, as this is the default value for uninitialized long fields in Java. This test is significant in the context of the application behavior as it ensures that the getAge method correctly handles cases where the age is not explicitly set.

  Scenario 3: Test to verify that the getAge method correctly retrieves the age after the growOld method is called

  Details:
    TestName: testGetAgeAfterGrowingOld
    Description: This test is meant to check the getAge method after the growOld method is called. The method should return the incremented age of the bacteria.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of Bacteria and set the age using the setAge method. Then call the growOld method.
    Act: Invoke the getAge method on the Bacteria instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getAge method to the expected result, which is the initial age plus one.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getAge method correctly retrieves the incremented age of the bacteria after the growOld method is called. The expected result is the initial age plus one. This test is significant in the context of the application behavior as it ensures that the age of the bacteria is correctly incremented and retrieved.
