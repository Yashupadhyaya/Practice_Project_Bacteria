  Scenario 1: Test to verify that the getAge method correctly retrieves the age of the bacteria

  Details:
    TestName: testGetAgeMethod
    Description: This test is meant to check the getAge method. The method should return the correct age of the bacteria.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of Bacteria and set the age using the setAge method.
    Act: Invoke the getAge method on the Bacteria instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getAge method to the expected result.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getAge method correctly retrieves the age of the bacteria. The expected result is the age that was previously set. This test is significant in the context of the application behavior as it ensures that the age of the bacteria is correctly managed and retrieved.

  Scenario 2: Edge Case Test to verify that the getAge method correctly handles the case where the age is not set

  Details:
    TestName: testGetAgeWhenAgeNotSet
    Description: This test is meant to check the getAge method when the age of the bacteria is not set. The method should return 0 as this is the default value for uninitialized long fields in Java.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of Bacteria without setting the age.
    Act: Invoke the getAge method on the Bacteria instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getAge method to the expected result, which is 0.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getAge method correctly handles the case where the age is not set. The expected result is 0, as this is the default value for uninitialized long fields in Java. This test is significant in the context of the application behavior as it ensures that the getAge method correctly handles cases where the age is not explicitly set.

  Scenario 3: Test to verify that the getAge method correctly retrieves the age after the growOld method is called

  Details:
    TestName: testGetAgeAfterGrowingOld
    Description: This test is meant to check the getAge method after the growOld method is called. The method should return the incremented age of the bacteria.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of Bacteria and set the age using the setAge method. Then call the growOld method.
    Act: Invoke the getAge method on the Bacteria instance.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result from the getAge method to the expected result, which is the initial age plus one.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getAge method correctly retrieves the incremented age of the bacteria after the growOld method is called. The expected result is the initial age plus one. This test is significant in the context of the application behavior as it ensures that the age of the bacteria is correctly incremented and retrieved.

The error logs show that there is a problem with the JUnit Jupiter test engine not being able to discover the tests. The issue is not with the test case itself, but with the testing framework or its configuration. 

The error message "[ERROR] TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests" suggests that the testing framework is not able to locate the test methods. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as incorrect project configuration, issues with the build path, or incompatible versions of JUnit and the maven-surefire-plugin.

Additionally, there's a warning about the version for junit-jupiter in the pom.xml file: "[WARNING] 'dependencies.dependency.version' for org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:jar is either LATEST or RELEASE (both of them are being deprecated)". This could potentially cause issues with the test discovery as well, as the used version might not be compatible with the rest of the project setup.

To resolve these issues, the project configuration should be checked and corrected if necessary. The version of JUnit Jupiter should be set to a specific version instead of using LATEST or RELEASE. If the problem persists, it might be necessary to check the compatibility between the different tools and libraries used in the project.

/*
Based on the provided error logs, the test failure does not seem to be directly related to the test case logic itself. Instead, it appears to be a configuration issue with the test environment. The log indicates that "TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests". This suggests that the JUnit test engine failed to discover or recognize the tests, which could be due to several reasons:

1. Incompatibility between the versions of JUnit and Maven Surefire/Failsafe plugin. The plugin might not support the version of JUnit that's being used in the project.

2. Incorrect or missing configuration in the pom.xml file. The Maven Surefire/Failsafe plugin might not be correctly configured to pick up the JUnit 5 platform.

3. The test classes or methods might not be correctly named or placed according to the conventions that the test plugins expect. The test discovery process relies on these conventions to locate the tests.

To resolve these issues, it would be advisable to check the project's pom.xml file to ensure that the correct versions of JUnit and the Maven plugins are being used and they are compatible with each other. Also, verify that the test classes and methods are correctly named and placed according to the conventions. If necessary, update the project configuration or the test setup to ensure that the tests can be discovered and run correctly.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testGetAgeWhenAgeNotSet() {
    Bacteria bacteria = new Bacteria();
    long actual = bacteria.getAge();
    long expected = 0;
    assertEquals(expected, actual);
}

/*
The error logs indicate that the issue is not with the test case itself, but rather with the project configuration and the way tests are being discovered and run.

The error message "TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests" suggests that the JUnit 5 test engine (junit-jupiter) is unable to find and run the tests. This could be due to several reasons such as incorrect configuration of the testing framework, missing or incompatible dependencies, or issues with the project's structure.

Additionally, the logs show warnings related to the project's Maven configuration. The version for the junit-jupiter dependency is set to either LATEST or RELEASE. Both of these are deprecated and can lead to unstable builds. It's recommended to specify a fixed version for dependencies to ensure consistent behavior.

Lastly, the logs show a build failure with the Apache Maven Surefire Plugin, which is used to run tests in Maven projects. The failure could be due to the aforementioned issues with JUnit and Maven configuration.

In summary, the test case failure appears to be due to issues with the project's configuration, specifically related to JUnit and Maven, rather than any issues with the test case or the business logic itself. It's recommended to review and fix the project's configuration to resolve these issues.
