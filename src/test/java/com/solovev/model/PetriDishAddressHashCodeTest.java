"""
Scenario 1: Validate the hashCode method for two similar objects

Details:
  TestName: validateHashCodeForSimilarObjects
  Description: This test is designed to validate that two objects with the same x and y values produce the same hashCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with identical x and y values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the hashCodes of both objects.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that two objects with the same x and y values produce the same hashCode. This is important for the correct functioning of the hashCode method, which should produce identical results for identical objects.

Scenario 2: Validate the hashCode method for two different objects

Details:
  TestName: validateHashCodeForDifferentObjects
  Description: This test is designed to validate that two objects with different x and y values produce different hashCodes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with different x and y values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the hashCodes of both objects.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that two objects with different x and y values produce different hashCodes. This is critical for the correct functioning of the hashCode method, which should produce different results for different objects.

Scenario 3: Validate the hashCode method for an object and its clone

Details:
  TestName: validateHashCodeForCloneObjects
  Description: This test is designed to validate that an object and its clone produce the same hashCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and its clone.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the hashCodes of both objects.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that an object and its clone produce the same hashCode. This is important for the correct functioning of the hashCode method, as clone objects should be considered identical.

Scenario 4: Validate the consistency of hashCode method

Details:
  TestName: validateHashCodeConsistency
  Description: This test is designed to validate that invoking the hashCode method multiple times on the same object consistently returns the same hashCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the object multiple times.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the hashCodes produced in each invocation.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that multiple invocations of the hashCode method on the same object consistently return the same hashCode. This is crucial for the correct functioning of the hashCode method, which should be consistent as long as the object remains unchanged.
