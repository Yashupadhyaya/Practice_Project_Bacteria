"""
Scenario 1: Validate the hashCode method for two similar objects

Details:
  TestName: validateHashCodeForSimilarObjects
  Description: This test is designed to validate that two objects with the same x and y values produce the same hashCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with identical x and y values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the hashCodes of both objects.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that two objects with the same x and y values produce the same hashCode. This is important for the correct functioning of the hashCode method, which should produce identical results for identical objects.

Scenario 2: Validate the hashCode method for two different objects

Details:
  TestName: validateHashCodeForDifferentObjects
  Description: This test is designed to validate that two objects with different x and y values produce different hashCodes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Address objects with different x and y values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the hashCodes of both objects.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that two objects with different x and y values produce different hashCodes. This is critical for the correct functioning of the hashCode method, which should produce different results for different objects.

Scenario 3: Validate the hashCode method for an object and its clone

Details:
  TestName: validateHashCodeForCloneObjects
  Description: This test is designed to validate that an object and its clone produce the same hashCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object and its clone.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the hashCodes of both objects.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that an object and its clone produce the same hashCode. This is important for the correct functioning of the hashCode method, as clone objects should be considered identical.

Scenario 4: Validate the consistency of hashCode method

Details:
  TestName: validateHashCodeConsistency
  Description: This test is designed to validate that invoking the hashCode method multiple times on the same object consistently returns the same hashCode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an Address object.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the object multiple times.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the hashCodes produced in each invocation.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that multiple invocations of the hashCode method on the same object consistently return the same hashCode. This is crucial for the correct functioning of the hashCode method, which should be consistent as long as the object remains unchanged.

/*
The test failure is not due to the business logic or any compilation issues within the test method. The test method seems to be correctly written, as it is creating two identical Address objects and checking if their hash codes are equal.

The issue here is with the test discovery process. The error log indicates that the TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests. This is a common issue when the JUnit 5 (Jupiter) engine is not properly set up or configured. 

The warning about 'dependencies.dependency.version' for org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:jar being either LATEST or RELEASE could also be connected to this issue. Using LATEST or RELEASE as a version number is deprecated and can lead to unstable builds, as the warning suggests.

To solve this issue, ensure that JUnit 5 and its Jupiter engine are correctly set up and configured. Check the version of the JUnit dependency in the project's pom.xml file. It should be a specific version number, not LATEST or RELEASE. Also, check that the maven-surefire-plugin is correctly configured for JUnit 5. 

After these checks and potential changes, the test discovery process should work correctly and the test method should execute and pass as expected.

The error logs indicate that the test engine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests. This is a common issue when the Maven Surefire Plugin is not able to find the test classes. This could be due to several reasons:

1. Incorrect Test Annotations: If the test classes or methods are not properly annotated with @Test or if the import for the @Test annotation is incorrect, the tests may not be discovered.

2. Version Compatibility: There could be a version mismatch between JUnit and the Maven Surefire Plugin. The Maven Surefire Plugin version 2.22.0 or above is required for JUnit 5.x tests.

3. Test Naming Convention: By default, the Surefire Plugin will automatically include all test classes with the following patterns: **/Test*.java , **/*Test.java , **/*Tests.java , **/*TestCase.java. If the test classes do not follow these naming conventions, they may not be discovered.

4. Project Dependencies: There may be missing or incorrect dependencies in the project's pom.xml. For instance, the JUnit Jupiter Engine dependency is required for running tests on the JUnit Platform.

In this case, the test method 'validateHashCodeForDifferentObjects' seems to be correctly annotated with @Test and @Tag("valid"). Also, the naming convention is followed as it is a method inside a test class, not the test class itself. Therefore, the issue is likely related to either version compatibility or project dependencies. Please check the version of JUnit and the Maven Surefire Plugin in your project's pom.xml file and ensure they are compatible. Also, check if all necessary dependencies for running tests with JUnit Jupiter are present.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void validateHashCodeForDifferentObjects() {
    PetriDish petriDish = new PetriDish();
    Address address1 = petriDish.new Address(5, 10);
    Address address2 = petriDish.new Address(6, 11);
    assertEquals(false, address1.hashCode() == address2.hashCode(), "Hash codes of different objects should not be equal");

The error logs indicate that there is an issue with the JUnit test discovery. The error message "TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests" suggests that the test runner is unable to discover any tests to run. 

The problem does not seem to be with the test method itself, rather, it is a configuration issue. This could be caused by several reasons such as:

1. Incorrect or missing dependencies in the pom.xml file. The project is using JUnit 5 (junit-jupiter), but there may be some issues with the version specified or it might not be included correctly in the pom.xml file.

2. The test classes or methods might not be named correctly or not following the naming conventions. By default, Maven Surefire Plugin, used for running tests in Maven projects, uses the following naming conventions: **/Test*.java **/*Test.java **/*Tests.java **/*TestCase.java. If the test classes or methods do not follow these conventions, they might not be discovered.

3. The test classes might not be in the correct directory. By default, Maven expects the test classes to be in the src/test/java directory. If they are not in this directory, they might not be discovered.

4. There might be some configuration issues with the maven-surefire-plugin.

To fix this issue, you should check the project's pom.xml file to ensure that the JUnit 5 dependencies are included correctly, the test classes and methods are named according to the conventions and they are in the correct directory. Also, check the configuration of the maven-surefire-plugin.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void validateHashCodeForCloneObjects() {
    PetriDish petriDish = new PetriDish();
    Address address1 = petriDish.new Address(5, 10);
    Address address2 = petriDish.new Address(address1.getX(), address1.getY());
    assertEquals(address1.hashCode(), address2.hashCode(), "Hash codes of a clone object should be equal to the original object");

The test failure seems to be due to the test discovery issue related to the JUnit Jupiter engine. The error log shows "TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests". This error usually occurs when the JUnit Jupiter engine is unable to discover any tests to run. 

The possible reasons for this could be:

1. There might be misconfiguration in the Maven Surefire Plugin. The latest versions of the Maven Surefire Plugin (2.22.0 or later) are required to run JUnit 5 tests and the version might be outdated.

2. The version of the JUnit Jupiter engine being used might be incompatible with the version of the Maven Surefire Plugin. 

3. There might be an issue with the project's dependencies, as the warning message suggests that the version for org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:jar is either LATEST or RELEASE, both of which are being deprecated.

4. There may be an issue with the project's build configuration, as the warning message states that there are problems that threaten the stability of the build.

5. The test class or method might not be correctly annotated with @Test or similar, or the test might not be public. 

Without further details or access to the complete project, it's hard to pinpoint the exact cause. But this error is related to the test discovery mechanism and environment, not the specific test case or the business logic itself.
