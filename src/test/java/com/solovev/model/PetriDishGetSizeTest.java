"""
Scenario 1: Validate the returned size of the PetriDish
TestName: validateSize
Description: This test is intended to check whether the getSize() method returns the correct size of the PetriDish.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the PetriDish with a known size.
  Act: Invoke the getSize() method on the created PetriDish instance.
  Assert: Compare the returned size against the known size of the PetriDish.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getSize() method correctly returns the size of the PetriDish. This is crucial to ensure that the size of the PetriDish is accurately represented and can be correctly retrieved when needed.

Scenario 2: Check for zero size of the PetriDish
TestName: checkZeroSize
Description: This test is intended to check whether the getSize() method correctly handles the scenario where the size of the PetriDish is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the PetriDish with a size of zero.
  Act: Invoke the getSize() method on the created PetriDish instance.
  Assert: Check that the returned size is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getSize() method can correctly handle and return a size of zero. This is vital as it allows the PetriDish to accurately represent scenarios where it is empty.

Scenario 3: Validate the size of the PetriDish after adding elements
TestName: validateSizeAfterAddingElements
Description: This test is intended to check whether the getSize() method correctly updates the size after elements have been added to the PetriDish.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the PetriDish and add a known number of elements to it.
  Act: Invoke the getSize() method on the created PetriDish instance.
  Assert: Compare the returned size against the known number of elements added.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the getSize() method accurately reflects changes in the size of the PetriDish after elements have been added. This is important to ensure that the size of the PetriDish is always up-to-date and accurately represents the current state of the PetriDish.
