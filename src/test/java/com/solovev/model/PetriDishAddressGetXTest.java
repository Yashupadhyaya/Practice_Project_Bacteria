Scenario 1: Verify getX method returns correct x-coordinate value

Details:
TestName: testGetXReturnsCorrectValue.
Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getX method. The target scenario is when the method is called, it should return the correct x-coordinate value of the Address instance.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a known x-coordinate.
Act: Invoke the getX method on the created instance.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the known x-coordinate.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the getX method correctly retrieves the x-coordinate of the Address instance. The expected result is based on the known x-coordinate set during the Arrange phase. This test is significant in ensuring that the object's state is accurately represented.

Scenario 2: Verify getX method returns consistent value on multiple invocations

Details:
TestName: testGetXReturnsConsistentValue.
Description: This test is meant to check that the getX method is idempotent, meaning it returns the same result if called multiple times without changing the state of the instance.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a known x-coordinate.
Act: Invoke the getX method on the created instance multiple times.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned values from each invocation.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the getX method is consistent and does not modify the state of the instance. The expected result is that all returned values should be equal. This test is important for ensuring the reliability and consistency of the method.

Scenario 3: Verify getX method returns correct value after changing the x-coordinate

Details:
TestName: testGetXReturnsUpdatedValue.
Description: This test is meant to check if the getX method returns the updated x-coordinate after it has been changed.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a known x-coordinate, then change the x-coordinate.
Act: Invoke the getX method on the updated instance.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the updated x-coordinate.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the getX method reflects the updated state of the instance. The expected result is based on the updated x-coordinate. This test is significant in ensuring that the object's state is accurately represented even after modification.

The error logs indicate that the test engine 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests. This does not necessarily mean there is an issue with the specific test function provided, but rather that the test engine itself is having trouble running the tests.

The issue could be due to a few reasons:

1. Incorrect or incompatible versions of JUnit and Maven Surefire Plugin: If the versions of JUnit and Maven Surefire Plugin used in the project are not compatible, the test engine may fail to discover tests. This is suggested by the warning message about 'dependencies.dependency.version' for org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:jar being deprecated.

2. Misconfiguration in the test setup: If the test setup is not correctly configured, the test engine may fail to discover the tests. This can occur if the tests are not correctly annotated, if the tests are in a package that is not correctly scanned, or if there are issues with the build configuration.

3. External dependencies not met: If the tests have external dependencies that are not met, the test discovery may fail. 

In this case, the test function seems to be correctly written and the 'PetriDish' and 'Address' classes seem to be correctly instantiated. The test failure seems to be due to issues in the test setup or environment, rather than in the test function or the business logic itself. Therefore, it is recommended to check the project's configuration and ensure that the correct and compatible versions of JUnit and Maven Surefire Plugin are used, and that all necessary dependencies are correctly included.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testGetXReturnsCorrectValue() {
    // Arrange
    PetriDish dish = new PetriDish();
    PetriDish.Address address = dish.new Address(5, 10);
    // Act
    int returnedX = address.getX();
    // Assert
    assertEquals(5, returnedX, "getX should return the correct x-coordinate value");
}

The error logs indicate that the test engine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests. This is not an issue with the provided test case itself, but rather an issue with the test environment or test configuration. 

One common reason for this error could be that the version of Junit Jupiter (the engine running the tests) is not compatible with the version of the maven-surefire-plugin used in the project. Another possible reason could be an incorrect or missing configuration in the POM file of the project.

To address this issue, you should ensure that the versions of Junit Jupiter and maven-surefire-plugin are compatible. If that doesn't solve the problem, you should check the configuration in the POM file, particularly the dependencies and plugins related to testing. You should also ensure that the test classes and methods are correctly annotated and that the project structure follows Maven's standard directory layout. 

Remember, the tests should be in a directory named 'test', not 'main', and the package structure under 'test' should mirror that under 'main'. If your tests are in non-standard locations, you may need to update your POM to tell surefire where to find them. 

Please note that this is a general explanation and the actual cause might differ based on the complete project setup.
@Test
@Tag("valid")
public void testGetXReturnsConsistentValue() {
    // Arrange
    PetriDish dish = new PetriDish();
    PetriDish.Address address = dish.new Address(5, 10);
    // Act
    int firstReturnedX = address.getX();
    int secondReturnedX = address.getX();
    // Assert
    assertEquals(firstReturnedX, secondReturnedX, "getX should return consistent value on multiple invocations");
}

The test failure appears to be due to an issue with the test environment rather than the test itself. The error logs indicate that the JUnit Jupiter test engine failed to discover tests. 

The warning message about 'dependencies.dependency.version' for org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:jar being either LATEST or RELEASE suggests that there might be an issue with the version of JUnit Jupiter specified in the Maven pom.xml file. Using LATEST or RELEASE as the version number is deprecated and can lead to unstable builds.

The error message "TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests" usually indicates that there's a problem with the JUnit setup in the test environment. 

The test itself appears to be correctly written and should not cause any compilation errors. The 'Address' object is correctly instantiated with boundary values for the x-coordinate, and the 'getX' method is correctly called on this object. The assertion checks if 'getX' returns the correct x-coordinate value, which is what the 'getX' method is supposed to do.

It's recommended to check the version of JUnit Jupiter specified in the Maven pom.xml file, and ensure that it's a specific version number rather than LATEST or RELEASE. Additionally, the test environment should be checked to ensure that it's correctly setup for running JUnit Jupiter tests.
@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testGetXReturnsCorrectValueForBoundaryCondition() {
    // Arrange
    PetriDish dish = new PetriDish();
    PetriDish.Address address = dish.new Address(0, 10);
    // Act
    int returnedX = address.getX();
    // Assert
    assertEquals(0, returnedX, "getX should return the correct x-coordinate value even for boundary conditions");
