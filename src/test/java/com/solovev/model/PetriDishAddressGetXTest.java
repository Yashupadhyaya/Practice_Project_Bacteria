Scenario 1: Verify getX method returns correct x-coordinate value

Details:
TestName: testGetXReturnsCorrectValue.
Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getX method. The target scenario is when the method is called, it should return the correct x-coordinate value of the Address instance.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a known x-coordinate.
Act: Invoke the getX method on the created instance.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the known x-coordinate.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the getX method correctly retrieves the x-coordinate of the Address instance. The expected result is based on the known x-coordinate set during the Arrange phase. This test is significant in ensuring that the object's state is accurately represented.

Scenario 2: Verify getX method returns consistent value on multiple invocations

Details:
TestName: testGetXReturnsConsistentValue.
Description: This test is meant to check that the getX method is idempotent, meaning it returns the same result if called multiple times without changing the state of the instance.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a known x-coordinate.
Act: Invoke the getX method on the created instance multiple times.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned values from each invocation.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the getX method is consistent and does not modify the state of the instance. The expected result is that all returned values should be equal. This test is important for ensuring the reliability and consistency of the method.

Scenario 3: Verify getX method returns correct value after changing the x-coordinate

Details:
TestName: testGetXReturnsUpdatedValue.
Description: This test is meant to check if the getX method returns the updated x-coordinate after it has been changed.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of the Address class with a known x-coordinate, then change the x-coordinate.
Act: Invoke the getX method on the updated instance.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the updated x-coordinate.
Validation:
The assertion aims to verify that the getX method reflects the updated state of the instance. The expected result is based on the updated x-coordinate. This test is significant in ensuring that the object's state is accurately represented even after modification.
