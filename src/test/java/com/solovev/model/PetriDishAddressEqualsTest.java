Scenario 1: Validate the equals method when both the addresses are same
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameAddresses
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the same address is compared with itself.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address instance.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the same address instance as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies when the same address is compared with itself. This is significant as it ensures the uniqueness of an address.

Scenario 2: Validate the equals method when the addresses are different
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentAddresses
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when two different addresses are compared.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Address instances with different coordinates.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing one address instance as a parameter to the equals method of the other.
    Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies when two different addresses are compared. This is significant as it ensures the correct identification of different addresses.

Scenario 3: Validate the equals method when the object passed is null
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when a null object is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address instance.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing null as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies when a null object is passed as a parameter. This is significant as it prevents NullPointerException.

Scenario 4: Validate the equals method when the object passed is not an instance of Address
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when an object of a different class is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address instance and an instance of a different class.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the different class object as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies when an object of a different class is passed as a parameter. This is significant as it ensures that only Address instances can be compared for equality.

The errors provided indicate that the JUnit Jupiter engine failed to discover any tests. This is not a failure of the test case itself, but rather an issue with the test infrastructure. 

The error message `TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests` suggests that the test runner (JUnit Jupiter in this case) was unable to find any tests to execute. This could be due to several reasons such as incorrect configuration, issues with the project setup, or incorrect usage of annotations.

One possible cause could be the version of JUnit being used. The warning message `[WARNING] 'dependencies.dependency.version' for org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:jar is either LATEST or RELEASE (both of them are being deprecated) @ line 22, column 16` suggests that the project is using a deprecated version for JUnit Jupiter. Using deprecated versions can lead to unexpected issues like the one we are seeing here.

Another possible cause could be the usage of the `@Tag` annotation. If the tag specified in the `@Tag` annotation is not recognized by the JUnit platform, it may cause the test to be skipped leading to the test engine not discovering any tests.

In conclusion, the test case is not failing due to an issue in the test case itself or the business logic it is testing. The failure is due to the test infrastructure not being able to discover any tests to execute. The versions of the dependencies and the project setup should be reviewed to fix this issue.

public void testEqualsWithSameAddresses() {
    PetriDish petriDish = new PetriDish();

}

/*
The test failure is not directly related to the business logic or the test case itself. Instead, the logs indicate that the JUnit 5 (Jupiter) engine failed to discover any tests to run. This is a build and configuration issue, rather than a problem with the test or the code under test.

The error message "TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests" suggests that the Maven Surefire Plugin, which is used to run tests in Maven projects, was unable to find any tests using the JUnit Jupiter test engine. This could be due to several reasons:

1. The test classes or methods might not be correctly annotated with @Test or other appropriate JUnit annotations.
2. The tests might not be in the correct directory structure that Surefire expects (typically src/test/java).
3. There might be a mismatch between the versions of JUnit and the Surefire plugin used in the project.
4. The JUnit Jupiter engine might not be correctly configured or included in the project.

To fix this issue, it would be necessary to ensure that the project is correctly set up for JUnit 5 testing, including correct use of annotations, correct test placement, and appropriate configuration in the project's pom.xml file.

It's also worth noting that the logs contain a warning about the JUnit Jupiter version being set to LATEST or RELEASE, which is deprecated. This should be replaced with a specific version number to prevent potential issues with unexpected updates.

@Tag("invalid")
public void testEqualsWithDifferentAddresses() {
    PetriDish petriDish = new PetriDish();
    PetriDish.Address address1 = petriDish.new Address(5, 5);
    PetriDish.Address address2 = petriDish.new Address(6, 6);
    assertFalse(address1.equals(address2), "The equals method should return false when two different addresses are compared.");
}

The errors provided indicate that the problem is not specifically related to the test method `testEqualsWithNullObject()`. The issue is that the JUnit Jupiter engine is unable to discover any tests at all. The error message `[ERROR] TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests` shows this.

The reason for the test engine not discovering tests could be several, including:

1. Incorrect setup of the testing framework: The JUnit Jupiter engine might not be correctly set up or integrated into the testing environment. The necessary dependencies for JUnit Jupiter might be missing, not correctly versioned, or not correctly configured.

2. Misconfigured test classes or methods: If test classes or methods are not correctly annotated or if they are not placed in the correct directories, the test engine might fail to discover them.

3. Dependency version issue: The warning message `[WARNING] 'dependencies.dependency.version' for org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:jar is either LATEST or RELEASE (both of them are being deprecated)` indicates that the version of Junit Jupiter being used is either set to LATEST or RELEASE, which are being deprecated. This might cause issues with the test discovery.

The problem is not with the test itself, but the project setup. This needs to be corrected for the test engine to discover and run the tests successfully. The developer should check the project's configuration, including its dependencies and the versions being used, to ensure everything is set up correctly for JUnit Jupiter.

@Test
@Tag("boundary")
public void testEqualsWithNullObject() {
    PetriDish petriDish = new PetriDish();
    PetriDish.Address address = petriDish.new Address(5, 5);
    assertFalse(address.equals(null), "The equals method should return false when a null object is passed as a parameter.");
}

/*
The error logs indicate that the issue is not with the test case itself, but rather with the test discovery process. The log states: "TestEngine with ID 'junit-jupiter' failed to discover tests". This is a common error that occurs when the testing framework is unable to locate or execute the test cases.

This can occur due to several reasons:

1. Incorrect or outdated versions of the testing libraries: The warning at the start of the logs suggests that the version of junit-jupiter being used is either 'LATEST' or 'RELEASE', both of which are deprecated. This could be causing compatibility issues leading to the failure in discovering tests.

2. Incorrect configuration: The test discovery process could also fail if the configuration in the pom.xml file or in the IDE settings is incorrect. 

3. Test file location: The test classes should be in the correct directory (typically 'src/test/java') for Maven to locate them.

4. Naming Conventions: Test classes and methods should follow the naming conventions (test classes should end with 'Test' and test methods should be annotated with '@Test').

In this case, it is recommended to check the project's configuration and the version of junit-jupiter being used. If the versions are deprecated, they should be updated to the latest stable version. Also, ensure that the test classes and methods are correctly named and located in the right directory.
