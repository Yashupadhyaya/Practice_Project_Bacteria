"""
Scenario 1: Validate the equals method when both the addresses are same
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameAddresses
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when the same address is compared with itself.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address instance.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the same address instance as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is true.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies when the same address is compared with itself. This is significant as it ensures the uniqueness of an address.

Scenario 2: Validate the equals method when the addresses are different
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentAddresses
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when two different addresses are compared.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Address instances with different coordinates.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing one address instance as a parameter to the equals method of the other.
    Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies when two different addresses are compared. This is significant as it ensures the correct identification of different addresses.

Scenario 3: Validate the equals method when the object passed is null
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when a null object is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address instance.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing null as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies when a null object is passed as a parameter. This is significant as it prevents NullPointerException.

Scenario 4: Validate the equals method when the object passed is not an instance of Address
Details:
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClassObject
  Description: This test is meant to check the equals method when an object of a different class is passed as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address instance and an instance of a different class.
    Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the different class object as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result of the equals method is false.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies when an object of a different class is passed as a parameter. This is significant as it ensures that only Address instances can be compared for equality.
